# How to Use

### Testing
In a terminal run `hugo server -D`.
 - Open the `localhost:1313` link it prints to the terminal.
 - Any changes to .md content files are updated in real time.

### Publishing to Github pages
In a terminal, run `hugo serve`. This produces the static site pages to the `public/` directory.

Double check that the `public/` directory is directed to the https://github.com/30Wedge/30Wedge.github.io repo.

`cd public`, then commit all and push.
